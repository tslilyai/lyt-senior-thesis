\section{Algorithm}

Our weakly transactional queue specification differs from that of the WQueue of Schwarz and Spector\cite{schwarz} because it 
talk about Schwarz and Spector queues

\section{Evaluation}

We evaluate the weakly transactional flat-combining queue on the same benchmarks described in Section \ref{microbenchmarks} to compare against the fully transactional flat-combining queue and our other STO queues.
