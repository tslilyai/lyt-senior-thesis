This thesis exists because of a single sentence, uttered at the end of a CS61 final exam: ``You should do research with me!'' I still wonder at my luck to have Professor Eddie Kohler as a mentor and advisor. He has done much more than simply provide invaluable guidance and ideas for my thesis research: over two years ago, Eddie stunned me with his request that I join his research group and his conviction that I might, in fact, have potential as a researcher in computer science. Without his support, this thesis and my life as a computer scientist might never have come to be.

    Of course, this thesis also owes its life to those who kept me going throughout the past four years (and for some, much longer): my ever-supportive parents who put up with me even at my most irritable; my sister who tolerates my bad thread puns; and my friends who generously provide ideas, remind me to take breaks, and (perhaps unwillingly) receive the latest news on trees, queues, and hashmaps.

        I would also like to thank those who worked on the STO system with and before me---Nathaniel Herman, Yihe Huang, Barbara Liskov, Jeevana Inala, and Liuba Shrira---as well as my thesis readers, Margo Seltzer and James Mickens. Both Professor Seltzer and Professor Mickens have been remarkable teachers and supporters; I am truly fortunate to have had such amazing mentors during my years here.
