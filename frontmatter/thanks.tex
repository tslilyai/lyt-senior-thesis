This thesis exists because of a single sentence, uttered at the end of the CS61 final exam: ``You should do research with me!'' I still often wonder at my luck to have Professor Eddie Kohler as a mentor and advisor. He has done much more than simply provide invaluable guidance and ideas for my thesis research: over two years ago, Eddie stunned me with his request that I join his research group and convinced me that I might, in fact, have potential as a researcher in computer science. Without his support, this thesis and I, as a computer scientist, might never have come to be.

    Of course, this thesis also owes its life to those who kept me going throughout the past four years: my ever-supportive parents who put up with me even at my most irritable; my sister who tolerates my bad thread puns; and my friends who remind me to take breaks and who (perhaps unwillingly) receive the latest news on trees, queues, and hashmaps.

        I would also like to thank those who worked on the STO system with and before me---Nathaniel Herman, Yihe Huang, Barbara Liskov, Jeevana Inala, and Liuba Shrira---as well as my thesis readers, Margo Seltzer and James Mickens. Both Professor Seltzer and Professor Mickens have been remarkable teachers and supporters; I am truly grateful to have had such amazing mentors during my years here.
