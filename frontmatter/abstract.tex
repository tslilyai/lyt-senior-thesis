STO is a novel software transactional memory system that both outperforms previous such systems and simplifies the challenging, yet increasingly critical task of parallel programming by providing transactional guarantees. 
However, STO's performance still falls short of that of the fastest concurrent programming techniques. This work discusses how to make STO as fast as these non-transactional concurrent programming patterns, and when this appears impossible, to characterize precisely why. By implementing and benchmarking the most performant concurrent programming patterns for abstract datatypes within STO's transactional framework, we determine that certain concurrent datatype algorithms appear to be inherently non-transactional; however, others can successfully support transactional guarantees without incurring a crippling performance loss. We claim this is due to the dependency of the concurrent algorithm on operation commutativity and implement concurrent datatypes in an alternative transactional interface with greater operation commutativity to support this claim. Our results indicate that an alternative transactional interface allows a concurrent datatype to greatly outperform its strongly transactional counterpart.
