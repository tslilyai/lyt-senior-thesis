Recent research has developed a novel software transactional memory system, STO, that both outperforms previous such systems and also simplifies the challenging, yet increasingly critical task of parallel programming by providing transactional guarantees. However, STO's performance falls short of that of the fastest concurrent programming techniques. This work aims to make STO as fast as these non-transactional concurrent programming patterns, and when this appears impossible, to characterize precisely why. By exploring different concurrent programming patterns for abstract datatypes, and implementing these datatypes within STO's framework, we determine that certain concurrent datatype algorithms are inherently non-transactional.
