Recent research has developed a novel software transactional memory system, STO, that both outperforms previous such systems and simplifies the challenging, yet increasingly critical task of parallel programming by providing transactional guarantees. However, STO's performance falls short of that of the fastest concurrent programming techniques. This work aims to make STO as fast as these non-transactional concurrent programming patterns, and when this appears impossible, to characterize precisely why. By implementing and benchmarking the most performant concurrent programming patterns for abstract datatypes within STO's framework, we determine that certain concurrent datatype algorithms are inherently non-transactional, while others can successfully be integrated with STO without crippling performance loss. We claim this is due to the dependency of the concurrency algorithm on operation commutativity, and measure performance for datatypes implemented in an alternative transactional interface with greater operation commutativity to test our claim.
